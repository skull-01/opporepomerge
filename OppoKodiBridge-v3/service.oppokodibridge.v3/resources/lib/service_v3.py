"""v3 service: install the playercorefactory.xml and publish the resolved config.

Unlike v2 this service does NOT intercept playback -- Kodi's playercorefactory does that. The service
only:
  1. resolves the add-on settings (the one place with Kodi APIs) and dumps them to
     ``runtime_config.json`` in the add-on's data dir, so the external player (which runs outside
     Kodi) can read them without xbmcaddon;
  2. writes ``playercorefactory.xml`` into the Kodi profile so disc content routes to the external
     player;
  3. idles, re-publishing the config if settings change, and removes the playercorefactory.xml on
     stop so disabling the add-on cleanly reverts Kodi to normal playback.
