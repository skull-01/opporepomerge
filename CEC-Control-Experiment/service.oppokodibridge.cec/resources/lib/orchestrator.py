"""The clean execution flow for one playback handoff (runs in the external pcf_player process):

    detector  -> is this a disc the OPPO should play?
    cec       -> grab the TV for the OPPO (its own One-Touch-Play)
    handoff   -> tell the OPPO to play the file
    monitor   -> watch until playback stops
    cec       -> reclaim the TV for Kodi (its own active source)

Every CEC assertion is single-shot, tied to an event: the OPPO grab fires once on play, the Kodi
reclaim fires once on stop (in the ``finally``, so it runs whether playback succeeded or failed). There
is NO standing re-asserter -- a manual input change must stick.
