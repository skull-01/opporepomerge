"""Watch OPPO playback state -- reports what is happening, asserts nothing.

Two-phase wait:
  Phase 1 (pre-playback) -- HTTP /getglobalinfo poll until playback STARTS. Verbose mode only carries
    useful info once the OPPO is actually playing, and the NFS mount + buffer can be slow, so the
    latency-tolerant HTTP poll owns the startup window.
  Phase 2 (playing) -- a fresh verbose ``#SVM 3`` connection blocks until ``@UPL STOP``, pushed the
    instant playback ends (no poll lag). Falls back to HTTP polling if the verbose channel fails.
