Each is fired exactly ONCE per play/stop event by the orchestrator. There is NO standing monitor that
re-asserts active source -- that would override a manual input change and make the TV un-leaveable
(CEC is open-loop; we cannot tell "the TV missed my frame" from "the user switched away"). Each device
asserts only its OWN source -- no injection, no foreign-initiator spoof.
