# Manual Verification Checklist

**Purpose:** the operator's queue of "agent claimed done; operator must verify before
closing the issue." Per the **only-operator-closes-issues** norm, agents never call
`gh issue close` and never write `Closes/Fixes/Resolves #N` — instead they comment the
implementing SHA(s) on the issue and append a row here.

## How to use

- **Agents:** when work seems done, append an entry under the right phase. Include the
  issue number, the implementing SHA(s), and the exact steps the operator should run to
  confirm.
- **Operator:** work the list top-down. When a row passes Phase C, close the GitHub
  issue and check the row off (or strike it out and move to a "Verified" archive section
  at the bottom).

## Phase definitions

- **Phase A — pre-merge.** PR is open. Operator verifies the diff makes sense, CI is
  green, and the change does what the issue says. Block: anything that should be fixed in
  the PR before merge.
- **Phase B — post-merge sanity.** PR is merged to `main`. Operator confirms `main` still
  builds + tests, nothing visible is broken. Block: a regression caught here typically
  means a hotfix or revert, not a slow re-verification cycle.
- **Phase C — operator end-to-end verify.** Operator runs the change in the real
  environment (Kodi on the actual box, the configurator on the actual Windows host,
  against the actual hardware chain). This is the **only** step that authorizes closing
  the issue.
