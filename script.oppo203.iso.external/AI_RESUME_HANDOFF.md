# AI_RESUME_HANDOFF.md — session continuity for `script.oppo203.iso.external`

**Audience:** any AI agent (Claude, Cursor, Codex, …) starting or resuming work on this
repo. Read this file **first**. Treat live code + `git`/`gh` output as authoritative; this
file is the map and the memory.

**Repo:** `github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external` · **Default branch:** `main`
**Last sync:** commit `f21033b` (origin/main, 2026-05-29 — Merge PR #46 ENH-#41 B+C atop PR #47 ENH-#43 lib split) · **Tests on `main`:** 886 passed, 3 skipped (`pytest -n auto`, ~10s; coverage 99.07%)
**Latest release:** v2.9.13 · **Issue model:** **hybrid** — GitHub Issues for bug/enhancement
tracking, PRs for delivery; every issue tagged `area:addon` or `area:configurator`.

**What this is:** A Python 3.9+ Kodi add-on (`script.oppo203.iso.external`) for OPPO 203/205
and compatible-clone external-player handoff, plus a new Tauri 2 + React/TS Windows
**configurator** under [`configurator/`](configurator/) that sets the add-on up (writes
`playercorefactory.xml` + the remote-bridge keymap, probes the TV/player, captures HDMI
inputs).

**Deep-archive companion** (historical builds, not the spine):
[`docs/ai-handoff/AI_RESUME_GUIDE.md`](docs/ai-handoff/AI_RESUME_GUIDE.md) and the
`Combined_AI_Handoff_*` build-reconstruction files.

# §1 The `resume` command

Work in this repo is split into **two areas** that share one machine and one git history:

- **Addon** — the Kodi add-on (Python under `resources/`, entry points `default.py` /
  `service.py`, release tooling under `tools/`, tests under `tests/`).
- **Configurator** — the Windows configurator app (Tauri 2 + React/TS under
  `configurator/`).

Issues are tagged with **`area:addon`** or **`area:configurator`** labels so the resume
command can summarize each area independently. Both areas live on `main`; one environment
serves both (see §2a).

When the operator types **`resume`** (alone), do exactly this:

1. **Read this file** (especially §3a "Addon work in progress" and §3b "Configurator work
   in progress") and the repo instruction files
   ([`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
2. **Run the unified environment readiness check** in §2a — it covers prerequisites for
   **both** areas (Python venv + dev deps for addon; Node + Rust + Tauri + WebView2 for
   configurator; plus the `area:addon` / `area:configurator` GitHub labels). Print a small
   readiness table.
   - All rows green → one line `Environment: ready ✓ (addon + configurator)` and continue.
   - An *auto-repo* row missing → install it (idempotent: `venv`, `pip install`, `npm
     install`, `gh label create --force`), re-check, report what was installed.
   - An *auto-system* row missing → attempt `winget install ... --silent
     --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements` (per row), re-check; on
     success continue, on failure print the manual fix and **STOP**.
   - A *manual* row missing → print the exact fix command and **STOP**.
3. **Report recent backlog activity per area.** Two parallel blocks, **Addon** then
   **Configurator**, each with:
   - *Last 5 issues created* — `gh issue list --label area:<area> --limit 5 --state all
     --sort created` — one line each as `#N <short title snippet>` (operator's "list
     issues with titles" norm).
   - *Last 5 issues closed* — `gh issue list --label area:<area> --limit 5 --state closed
     --sort updated` — same formatting.
   - *Work in progress* — paraphrase §3a (for addon) or §3b (for configurator) in 2–4
     lines: the in-flight branch/PR, what's done, what's left, blockers.

   If any issues exist that carry neither `area:addon` nor `area:configurator`, list them
   under a short **Unclassified** tail (≤5 rows) so they can be triaged.
4. **Suggest themes per area, separately** (still one theme = one session per §4).
   - **Addon — 1–3 candidate themes**, each one line, leading with any unfinished §3a
     entry.
   - **Configurator — 1–3 candidate themes**, each one line, leading with any unfinished
     §3b entry.

   **STOP and wait** for the operator to pick **one area and one theme** before doing any
   new work. Do not start work in both areas in the same session (§4 session-shape rule).

## Other natural-language triggers any agent must honor

| Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **`done for the day`** | Run §2 fully. |
| **`confirmation queue`** | List open issues whose implementing SHA was commented (per §17a / the "only operator closes" norm) but which the operator hasn't verified/closed yet. |
| **`bugs`** | `gh issue list --label type:bug --state open` — format each row as `#N <title snippet>`. |
| **`enhancements`** | `gh issue list --search "ENH- in:title" --state open` — same formatting. |
| **`backlog audit`** | Report from §17a cache first; ask before re-scanning live GitHub state (per operator norm #10). |
| **`build plan`** | Show contents of [`docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`](docs/BUILD_PLAN.md) (create as stub on first use). |
| **`refresh the build plan`** | Regenerate `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` from live open issues. |
| **`dev note: <text>`** | Append `<text>` VERBATIM (dated, no editing, no summarizing) to §20. |
| **`update AI_RESUME_HANDOFF.md`** | Run the maintenance recipe at the end of §2. |

Slash-command equivalents: `/resume`, `/done-for-the-day`, `/release`.

---

# §2 The `done for the day` command

When the operator types **`done for the day`**, do exactly this:

1. **Push ALL current work to the active branch.** No work left only on this machine.
   - Tests green → normal commit + `git push -u origin <branch>`.
   - Tests red or work mid-flight → `wip: <short summary>` checkpoint commit + push. Note
     the wip status in §3 so next session knows it's not done.
2. **Update §3 "Work in progress" — overwrite §3a and §3b independently.** Touch only the
   area(s) you actually worked in this session. For each touched area: current state,
   what's in flight, the clean stopping point for tomorrow, any blockers. If you didn't
   touch an area, leave its subsection unchanged. If an area ended clean, write `(none)`
   in its subsection so next `resume` reports it as a fresh slate.
3. **Append a dated entry to §19** "Updates to this document" — one bullet per material
   change (this entry, plus anything new added during the session).
4. **Refresh the §17a backlog audit cache** if any issues were opened, closed, or
   meaningfully retitled this session.
5. **Commit + push the handoff** — `docs: end-of-day handoff <YYYY-MM-DD>` on `main` if
   you have direct-to-main rights for docs-only changes, otherwise via short-lived PR.
6. **End-of-day summary** — 2-4 lines: what shipped today, what's open, what to pick up
   first tomorrow. Do **NOT** start new feature work.

Maintenance recipe (for `update AI_RESUME_HANDOFF.md`): refresh §3, §17a; append §19; if
substantive Q&A happened, append §21; verify §2a still matches the actual readiness check.

---

# §2a Environment readiness

The readiness check verifies the **single Windows machine** can edit, test, and build
**both** areas — the Kodi add-on (Python) **and** the Tauri 2 configurator (Node + Rust +
WebView2). One pass covers both.

**Tiers.** `auto-repo` = idempotent and runs in user scope, the resume command does it
without prompting. `auto-system` = the resume command attempts `winget install` (best
effort, no admin elevation requested; user-scope installs don't need it); on success it
re-checks and continues, on failure it prints the manual fix and **STOPS**. `manual` = an
operator action the resume command will not perform (auth flows, browser-redirect installs).

| Row | Prereq | How to check (PowerShell) | Tier | Install command |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **git** ≥ 2.30 | `git --version` | auto-system | `winget install --id Git.Git -e --silent --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements` |
| 2 | **`gh` CLI** authenticated | `gh auth status` | manual | `gh auth login` (operator approves the browser flow) |
| 3 | **Python** 3.9+ on PATH | `python --version` | auto-system | `winget install --id Python.Python.3.12 -e --silent --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements` |
| 4 | Repo **`.venv`** | `Test-Path .venv` | auto-repo | `cd C:\Users\rigel\Documents\gitrepo\script.oppo203.iso.external; python -m venv .venv` |
| 5 | **Python dev deps** | `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest --version` | auto-repo | `cd C:\Users\rigel\Documents\gitrepo\script.oppo203.iso.external; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt paramiko` |
| 6 | **paramiko** (SSH probes) | `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import paramiko"` | auto-repo | covered by row 5 |
| 7 | **Node** 20+ | `node -v` | auto-system | `winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e --silent --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements` |
| 8 | **npm** 10+ | `npm -v` | bundled | comes with Node row 7 |
| 9 | configurator **`node_modules`** | `Test-Path configurator\node_modules` | auto-repo | `cd C:\Users\rigel\Documents\gitrepo\script.oppo203.iso.external\configurator; npm install` |
| 10 | **Rust toolchain** 1.77+ | `cargo --version; rustc --version` | auto-system | `winget install --id Rustlang.Rustup -e --silent --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements; rustup default stable` |
| 11 | **MSVC Build Tools** (Tauri linker) | `(Get-Command link.exe -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) -ne $null` or `cd configurator; npm run tauri info` | auto-system | `winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools -e --silent --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"` (multi-GB; first run is slow) |
| 12 | **WebView2 runtime** | `Test-Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Clients\{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BDF-00C3A9A7E4C5}'` | bundled-w11 | bundled with Windows 11; if absent: `winget install --id Microsoft.EdgeWebView2Runtime -e --silent --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements` |
| 13 | **Configurator icon** (placeholder OK) | `Test-Path configurator\src-tauri\icons\icon.ico` | auto-repo | generate from a placeholder PNG via `cd configurator; npm run tauri icon -- ../docs/installuidraft/.../placeholder.png` (or commit a stub `icon.ico`); blocks `cargo build` otherwise |
| 14 | Repo has **`area:addon`** and **`area:configurator`** labels | `gh label list --json name --jq '.[].name' \| Select-String '^area:(addon\|configurator)$'` returns both | auto-repo | `gh label create area:addon --color 0E8A16 --description "Kodi add-on (Python)" --force; gh label create area:configurator --color 5319E7 --description "Windows configurator (Tauri 2)" --force` |

**PATH gotcha on Windows after row 10 installs:** the cargo bin dir
(`$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin`) is NOT on the inherited PATH of fresh `PowerShell` tool
calls until a shell restart. Prefix every cargo invocation in the same session as the
install with `$env:PATH = "$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin;" + [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH","Machine") + ";" + [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH","User"); `
or call cargo by full path.

Rows are checked in order; a missing row at any tier is acted on per its tier rule
described above. There is no database; no external services to verify. (Memory note
`tauri-env-installed` records that rows 10/11 already passed on 2026-05-29; row 13 was
satisfied by PR #35 merging the icon stub at `12e5b18`.)

## §3a Addon work — in progress

**As of 2026-05-29 (EOD — PR #47 + #46 merge session):** both formerly-in-flight
draft PRs are **merged to `main`**; clean stopping point, no in-flight addon code.
`main` advanced `23d43ae` → **`f21033b`** — **886 passed, 3 skipped**, coverage
**99.07%**. This session reviewed both PRs, merged ENH-#43 (#47), integrated
ENH-#41 B+C (#46) onto the post-#47 `main`, and verified the **combination**
before landing it.

- **Shipped this session — both PRs merged via `gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch`:**
  - [PR #47](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/47)
    — *split `resources/lib` into tv/oppo/avr/kodi sub-packages (ENH-#43)* —
    **merged at `3ba5009`**. 46 modules bucketed (`version.py` → `kodi/`); legacy
    flat names (`resources.lib.X` + bare `X`) keep resolving via the lazy
    `sys.meta_path` alias finder in
    [`resources/lib/__init__.py`](resources/lib/__init__.py).
  - [PR #46](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/46)
    — *in-add-on configurator-owner hint + overwrite warning (ENH-#41 Parts B+C)*
    — **merged at `f21033b`**. Static lsep banner + once-per-session toast +
    42-key (`CONFIGURATOR_MANAGED_KEYS`) overwrite warning in
    `service.Monitor.onSettingsChanged` (logging/notification only, no state
    mutation).

- **Merge mechanics (lesson for future multi-PR sessions):** the prior §3a
  claimed these two PRs touched "disjoint files" — **wrong.** They overlapped on
  `service.py`, `tests/test_all.py`, and `docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md`;
  GitHub reported both MERGEABLE only because each was diffed against the *old*
  `main`. Handled by merging #47 first, then merging the new `main` into #46's
  branch locally (clean auto-merge — the insertions fell in distinct regions),
  running the **full gate on the integrated tree** (commit `126bac9`), pushing,
  waiting for CI green, then merging #46. **Lesson:** when two open PRs both look
  mergeable, verify the *combination* locally — don't trust two independent green
  CIs.

- **Verified on combined `main`** (`f21033b`, tree-identical to gated `126bac9`):
  `pytest -n auto` **886/3**; serial coverage **99.07%** (≥99% floor); ruff
  check+format clean on `resources default.py service.py`; `unittest discover`
  **505 OK**; `audit_release` **580/580**; doc/version/layout/i18n `--check` OK;
  `main` push-CI green (incl. the Ubuntu-only `package_release.sh`). Merge SHAs
  commented on
  [#43](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/issues/43#issuecomment-4571133909)
  and
  [#41](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/issues/41#issuecomment-4571134996).
  Software-verified only; Phase A/C on-device steps still queued in the manual
  checklist.

- **What to resume next session:**
  - **Operator: verify + close #43 and #41** (merge SHAs commented; only the
    operator closes issues). #41 is **only partly done** — its addon side (Parts
    B+C) shipped, but the **configurator side of Part C** (writing the
    `<!-- generated by configurator vX.Y.Z YYYY-MM-DD -->` marker into the
    generated `settings.xml`) is still open → `area:configurator` session.
  - **ENH-#42** (minimal in-add-on settings menu) is now **unblocked** by #43's
    bucket layout — strongest addon lead.
  - Phase A on-device verification of #40 / #46 / #47 (whenever hardware is to
    hand) — all queued in the manual checklist.

- **Carried open after this session (all `area:addon`):**
  [#38](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/issues/38)
  (ruff backlog),
  [#41](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/issues/41)
  (configurator-owns-config — addon B+C **merged** at `f21033b`; configurator
  side of Part C still open),
  [#42](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/issues/42)
  (in-add-on settings menu — now unblocked),
  [#43](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/issues/43)
  (lib split — **merged** at `3ba5009`, awaiting operator close),
  [#44](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/issues/44)
  (hardware-validation testing). Only the operator closes issues.

- **Candidate themes for next addon session** (pick one, per §4):
  1. **ENH-#42 — minimal in-add-on settings menu** — now unblocked by #43's
     bucket layout; clean lead.
  2. **#38 ruff backlog PR 1 (auto-fix sweep)** — independent; parallel-session
     friendly.
  3. **Phase A device verification** for #40 / #46 / #47 — operator action on
     real hardware, no agent code.

## §3b Configurator work — in progress

**As of 2026-05-29 (PM bulk-merge — done for the day):** scaffold + first three
follow-ups landed; queue cleared of stale drafts. No in-flight code; clean stopping
point.

- **PR #30** (Scaffold OppoKodiAddon Configurator) — **merged** earlier at `394f9fc`.
- **PR #33** (window-control IPC on custom title bar) — **merged 2026-05-29 PM at
  `45c6572`**.
- **PR #34** (persist WizardState to `%APPDATA%`) — **merged 2026-05-29 PM at
  `bc60074`**.
- **PR #35** (unblock first-time cargo build — icon stub + lockfile + winget docs) —
  **merged 2026-05-29 PM at `12e5b18`**. §2a row 13 (icon) is now satisfied; the
  `configurator-icon-files-missing` memory was pruned this EOD.
- **PR #32** (docs: align AGENTS.md ruff target; refresh §3 for #30) — **closed without
  merge** in the PM bulk-merge as superseded by subsequent §3 rewrites; the AGENTS.md
  parenthetical was deemed in tension with `area:addon` issue #38 (ruff backlog).
- **PR #36** (mid-day EOD handoff) — **closed without merge** as a stale snapshot
  superseded by later EOD entries on `main`.

- **No `area:configurator` issues open.** §17a cache has no configurator rows.

- **Candidate themes for next configurator session** (pick one, per §4):
  1. **Real side effects** behind the diag logs (SFTP probe for Tier A, SMB probe for
     Tier B, TCP port knock for TV-backend detection, OPPO `#EJT`/`#QPW` over port 23) —
     multi-PR theme, its own session. #33 (IPC) and #34 (state) are now landed.
  2. **File generation** for [`playercorefactory.xml`](resources/playercorefactory.xml)
     + remote-bridge keymap. This is the configurator side of ENH-#41 (the add-on side
     stays read-only per the policy doc just landed).
  3. **App icon + bundling polish** — #35 landed a stub icon; replacing it with a real
     icon + first-pass `npm run tauri build` of an .msi/.exe is an open theme.
  4. **Configurator side of ENH-#41 Part C** — write
     `<!-- generated by configurator vX.Y.Z YYYY-MM-DD -->` into the generated
     `settings.xml`; pairs with the add-on-side overwrite warning that lands in the
     addon area as part of Part C.

# §4 Build norms

- **Session shape — one theme per session, soft cap ≤ 4 PRs.** Mixing themes within a
  session is where bugs slip in (proven in retros). If the operator nudges into a second
  theme, suggest finishing the current one and resuming next session.
- **No inline code comments by default.** Add only when the WHY is non-obvious (subtle
  invariant, workaround for a specific bug). Never explain WHAT — identifiers do that.
- **Lint/test backstop** — `pytest -n auto` + `ruff check .` must pass before promoting a
  PR out of draft. For configurator changes: `npx tsc --noEmit && npm run build` too.
- **Honest signature** — claim only what was actually run in this session. "Code compiles"
  ≠ "feature works". Distinguish typecheck / unit-tested / clicked-through / verified by
  operator. Never weaken the project's
  **"software-verified / hardware validation not claimed"** wording.
- **Scope discipline** — don't refactor adjacent code. Don't add features, abstractions,
  fallbacks, or validation the task doesn't require. Smallest possible diff.
- **Test link norm** — every completed change ends with one copy-paste line (run command
  or unittest command) + URL.
- **Only the operator closes issues** — never `gh issue close`, never `Closes #N`. Comment
  the SHA on the issue and add a verification step to
  [`docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md).

# §14 Gotchas (accumulate as hit)

_Format: `### YYYY-MM-DD — short title` · what bit us · how we recovered · how to prevent._

### 2026-05-29 — `build\_tmp` from the Windows pytest TEMP workaround can leave OS-locked dirs that break `audit_release.py`

- **What bit us:** an earlier session had used the historical Windows workaround
  (`$env:TEMP = build\_tmp; $env:TMP = $env:TEMP`) before running pytest. A handful of
  `build\_tmp\tmpXXXXXXXX\` subdirs ended up with ACLs that denied `Remove-Item`, `cmd
  rmdir /s/q`, `takeown /f`, and `icacls /grant` even from a normal user shell — likely
  Defender / a file-indexer holding handles. `tools/audit_release.py` walks the repo and
  prints `Can't list 'C:\…\build\_tmp\tmpXXX'` to stdout when it hits one; that line
  precedes the JSON payload and breaks two tests that call the audit CLI with `--json`:
  `tests/test_v291_build10_audit_reporter_refactor.py::test_audit_cli_json_output_still_works`
  and `tests/test_all.py::TBuild5ReleaseAuditArtifacts::test_release_audit_cli_json`.
- **How we recovered:** since the lock could not be cleared without admin/reboot,
  `Move-Item build\_tmp $env:USERPROFILE\build_tmp_LOCKED_delete_after_reboot` (rename
  only needs parent write access, not contents access) moved it out of the repo; the two
  tests then passed. Locked tree can be deleted with `rmdir /s/q` after the next reboot
  frees the handles.
- **How to prevent:** the full suite passed this session in ~8.5s **without** the
  `$env:TEMP=build\_tmp` override (just `--basetemp="build\_pt"` and
  `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1`). The override may no longer be necessary on this
  machine. Try without it first; only reach for it if `WinError 5` (or a similar
  permission-denied) actually appears, and prefer routing TEMP to a path **outside the
  repo** (e.g. a freshly created `$env:USERPROFILE\.pytest-tmp`) so the audit walker
  cannot reach it.

# §15 Development journey

_Append-only, newest-last. One bullet per material commit or session-shaping decision._

- **2026-05-28** — Scaffolded the Windows configurator under `installer/` (Tauri 2 + Vite +
  React + TS, Direction A "Warm Paper" tokens). PR #30 opened as draft.
- **2026-05-28** — Renamed `installer/` → `configurator/` plus all identifiers (npm
  package, Cargo crate, Tauri bundle id) because the app *configures* an already-installed
  add-on; "installer" was a misnomer carried from the design handoff.
- **2026-05-28** — Ported all 21 remaining wizard screens from
  `docs/installuidraft/design_handoff_oppo_installer/prototype/` into typed TSX
  (`screens/step1.tsx` through `screens/test.tsx`). Bundle: 47 modules / 215 KB JS / 25 KB
  CSS.
- **2026-05-28** — Bootstrapped this AI handoff + agent norms structure
  (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `AI_RESUME_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md`)
  per operator's job_finder_ri norms. Existing spine docs replaced wholesale. Issue model
  set to hybrid (Issues for bug/enhancement tracking, PRs for delivery).
- **2026-05-29** — ENH-#43: split the flat `resources/lib` (46 modules) into
  `tv/` / `oppo/` / `avr/` / `kodi/` sub-packages, canonical name
  `resources.lib.<bucket>.<module>`. A lazy `sys.meta_path` alias finder in
  `resources/lib/__init__.py` preserves legacy flat names (`resources.lib.X`
  and bare `X`) as same-object aliases during a deprecation window; `version.py`
  → `kodi/`. Draft PR #47. Established convention: module-top cross-family
  imports explicit (`from ..oppo… import`), lazy in-function imports bare
  (finder-resolved, mock-friendly).
- **2026-05-29** — Merged the two in-flight addon PRs onto `main`: **ENH-#43**
  lib split (PR #47 at `3ba5009`) and **ENH-#41 Parts B+C** configurator-owner
  hint (PR #46 at `f21033b`). The PRs overlapped on `service.py` /
  `tests/test_all.py` / the manual checklist despite the prior §3a "disjoint"
  note; integrated #46 onto the post-#47 `main` locally, ran the full gate on the
  combined tree (commit `126bac9`: 886/3, coverage 99.07%), then merged. `main`
  `23d43ae` → `f21033b`; test count 865 → 886.

# §19 Updates to this document

_Meta-log of changes to this handoff itself. Dated, newest-last. Maintained by
`done for the day`._

- **2026-05-28** — Bootstrapped from scratch per operator's job_finder_ri norms. Replaced
  the prior 397-line PR-only handoff. Sections §1 / §2 / §2a / §3 / §4 filled; §5–§17a /
  §19–§21 seeded as headers.
- **2026-05-28 (EOD)** — First `done for the day` cycle. Refreshed §3 to point at PR #30
  awaiting review + the chain of follow-up themes; both branches confirmed pushed and in
  sync with origin (`main`@`636ae35`, `claude/windows-installer-ui-gfv4m`@`edba3d1`). No
  issues opened/closed/retitled — §17a cache remains empty.
- **2026-05-29 (EOD)** — Verification + cleanup session, no code changes. Refreshed §3
  to record today's work (claude-review CI fix verified to the limit of what can be
  proven before the next dependabot batch; memory hygiene); added the first §14 Gotcha
  (`build\_tmp` Windows-locked tmpdirs vs. `audit_release.py`); updated the header
  "Last sync" / "Tests on `main`" to `4e54c5d` / 987 passed, 3 skipped. PR #30 unchanged.
  §17a still empty (no issues opened/closed/retitled).
- **2026-05-29 (spine-revision branch — EODs #2, #3)** — Parallel history on
  `docs/eod-handoff-2026-05-29-pm` (PR #37). Authored the §3a/§3b two-area
  restructure of §1, §2a, §3, AGENTS.md, `.claude/commands/resume.md`,
  `docs/ai-handoff/AI_RESUME_GUIDE.md` §9; ran one addon session under the new
  spine (audited `wip/wizard-ux` for v2.9.14, fixed a single ruff I001 in
  `tools/dev_build.py`, filed issue #38 for the 336-error ruff backlog).
  **Header "Last sync" on that branch was `394f9fc`** (the PR #30 merge); tests
  on `wip/wizard-ux` were 999 passed / 3 skipped / 99.10% coverage. The §3a/§3b
  content authored on that branch is preserved only via this entry — the actual
  §3a/§3b on `main` was overwritten by the PM bulk-merge entry below.
- **2026-05-29 (EOD — strip-wizard session)** — End-of-day after a single-theme
  addon session that stripped the in-Kodi setup wizard from the add-on. PR
  [#40](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/40) on
  `claude/strip-wizard-g4feovqi` (tip `92a9408`) was open as draft. 44 files
  changed, +313 / −5814. Tests: **865 passed, 3 skipped** in ~10s on the strip
  branch; coverage **99.05%** (≥ 99% floor). Filed 4 new `area:addon` ENH
  issues — #41 configurator-owns-config policy, #42 in-add-on settings menu,
  #43 module split (TV/Oppo/AVR/Kodi), #44 hardware-testing solicitation.
  Created [`docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`](docs/BUILD_PLAN.md) on `main` (commit
  `3967cb6`) with the strategic direction + open-issue grid + suggested
  ordering. Header "Last sync" updated from `4e54c5d` to `3967cb6`; tests on
  `main` re-confirmed at **987 passed, 3 skipped** in ~12s. §3 rewritten to
  record the strip-wizard PR + new issues; §17a backlog cache populated for
  the first time (with Area column added) — six rows: #22 (closed), #38, #41,
  #42, #43, #44.
- **2026-05-29 (EOD — config-owner-policy session)** — Second `done for
  the day` cycle on 2026-05-29, after the strip-wizard EOD at `7b65ed2`.
  Single-theme addon session that drafted **Part A** (policy doc) of
  [ENH-#41](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/issues/41).
  PR [#45](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/45) on
  `claude/config-owner-policy-a3k7m2nq` (tip `1ed15a3`) opened as draft.
  3 files changed, +70 / −1: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) gained
  `## Configuration is owned by the configurator`,
  [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) gained `## Configuration ownership`
  (matching policy framed for external contributors),
  [`docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md)
  gained a Phase A row for the #45 review. Tests on the policy-doc branch:
  **987 passed, 3 skipped** in 10.69s; coverage **99.08%**. SHA `1ed15a3`
  commented on issue #41 per the only-operator-closes-issues norm. Parts B + C
  of #41 deferred to the next session — both touch `resources/settings.xml`,
  which PR #40 also modifies.
- **2026-05-29 (PM — bulk-merge session)** — Operator typed `resume` then
  directed "merge all pending, operator will skip review." Bulk-merged the
  five mergeable PRs in dependency order:
  [#40](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/40)
  strip-wizard at `59eb511`,
  [#45](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/45)
  config-owner-policy Part A at `816bde2` (after resolving a
  `docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` conflict that preserved both #40 and
  #45 Phase A entries),
  [#33](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/33)
  window-control IPC at `45c6572`,
  [#34](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/34) state
  persistence at `bc60074`,
  [#35](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/35) cargo
  unblock at `12e5b18`. Closed three superseded/stale PRs without merge:
  [#39](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/39)
  (wip/wizard-ux — predecessor of #40),
  [#36](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/36) (stale
  mid-day handoff),
  [#32](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/32) (stale
  §3 refresh + ruff-target line now in tension with #38). Resolved this PR
  ([#37](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/37) the
  two-area spine revision) against the new `main`: took #37's structural
  changes (§1 step 2 multi-area wording, §2a's 14-row table with `auto-repo` /
  `auto-system` / `manual` tiers, §3a/§3b split, AGENTS.md area-label rule,
  `.claude/commands/resume.md` two-area procedure, AI_RESUME_GUIDE.md §9
  update); took `main`'s §17a (6 rows); rewrote §3b to record the four
  configurator-area PR outcomes this session; **§3a still carries the stale
  wip/wizard-ux v2.9.14 content from #37 and will be overwritten by the next
  EOD**. `pytest -n auto --basetemp=build\_pt` on `main` after the five
  merges: **865 passed, 3 skipped in 10.40s** (test count dropped from 987 →
  865 because #40 deleted the wizard test files; coverage **99.05%** ≥ 99%
  floor). Phase A on-device verification of #40 was **NOT** performed —
  operator chose to defer per the skip-review directive; revert remains
  available if hardware testing later flags an issue. No `area:configurator`
  labels back-applied to any prior items in this session.
- **2026-05-29 (EOD — `done for the day` after PM bulk-merge)** — Doc-only
  refresh. Header "Last sync" updated from `7b65ed2` to `bc79649` (PR #37
  merge); test count updated from 987 → **865 passed, 3 skipped** to reflect
  the wizard test files deleted by #40 (coverage **99.05%** on the lower
  denominator). **§3a rewritten** to drop #37's stale wip/wizard-ux v2.9.14
  content (replaced by main's current addon state: PR #40 + #45 shipped, #41
  Parts B + C unblocked, five open addon issues #38/#41/#42/#43/#44, candidate
  themes refreshed). **§3b dedeuplicated** (two "As of" headers merged into
  one, no content change beyond noting the `configurator-icon-files-missing`
  memory was pruned this EOD and adding a fourth candidate theme for the
  configurator-side ENH-#41 Part C). **§2a parenthetical** updated to note PR
  #35 satisfied row 13 (icon stub). **Memory pruned:** deleted
  `configurator-icon-files-missing.md` (carved out by PR #35); MEMORY.md index
  updated. **No new code commits, no new issues, no new branches.** Tree
  clean; `pytest -n auto --basetemp=build\_pt` on `main` re-confirmed at 865
  passed / 3 skipped / 9.95s.
- **2026-05-29 (EOD — ENH-#41 Parts B + C addon session)** — Single-theme
  addon session that implemented the addon-side of
  [ENH-#41](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/issues/41)
  Parts B (in-add-on guidance hint) and C (configurator-managed-key
  overwrite warning). PR
  [#46](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/46) on
  `claude/enh41-bc-config-hint-a4n9k2m` (tip `3ccd9f1`) opened as draft. 17
  files changed, +697 / -3:
  [`service.py`](service.py) gained the `CONFIGURATOR_MANAGED_KEYS`
  constant (42 keys), `_snapshot_managed_settings` /
  `_changed_managed_keys` / `_resolve_localized` /
  `_notify_config_hint_once_per_session` /
  `_warn_overwritten_managed_keys` helpers, and a new `Monitor.__init__`
  + `Monitor.onSettingsChanged` that fires Part B's once-per-session
  toast and Part C's per-key warning (the class docstring records the
  no-state-mutation invariant preserved from PR #40);
  [`resources/settings.xml`](resources/settings.xml) gained one `<setting
  id="config_owner_hint" label="30290" type="lsep"/>` at the top of
  `<category id="connection">` (`tests/test_all.py` settings-count
  assertion bumped 97 → 98); 12 PO files gained four new strings (#30290
  banner, #30291 notification body, #30292 per-key warning template with
  `{key}` placeholder, #30293 notification title — non-en_gb files use
  msgid=msgstr fallback per convention);
  [`tests/test_v2914_build1_config_owner_hint.py`](tests/test_v2914_build1_config_owner_hint.py)
  is new with 21 tests across 5 classes (`TManagedKeysContent`,
  `TSnapshotAndDiff`, `TNotificationHelpers`, `TMonitor`,
  `TSettingsXmlAndPo`);
  [`docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md)
  gained a Phase A entry with a six-step Phase C on-device verification
  script for #46. Tests on the work branch: **886 passed, 3 skipped** in
  ~9.5s (the +21 over `main`'s 865 are this PR's new tests); ruff clean
  on touched Python files (257 pre-existing repo-wide errors covered by
  [ENH-#38](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/issues/38)).
  SHA `3ccd9f1` commented on issue #41 per the only-operator-closes
  norm. Kodi-API caveat documented in the PR body: there is no "settings
  dialog opened" event; Part B's "first-open" notification is
  implemented as "first **change** per session", with the always-visible
  lsep banner as the on-open counterpart. **§3a rewritten** to record
  open draft PR #46, what's done, what's left, and refreshed candidate
  themes. **§3b not touched** (no configurator work this session).
  **§17a row for #41 updated** to record the Parts B + C SHA on draft
  PR #46 (configurator side of Part C still pending). **Header
  unchanged** — "Last sync" stays at `bc79649` and tests-on-`main` at
  865/3/99.05% because `main` had no operational changes this session.
  Phase A on-device verification of #46 deferred to next session; Phase
  A of #40 still deferred from PM bulk-merge.
- **2026-05-29 (EOD — ENH-#43 lib sub-package split session)** — Two-part
  addon session. (1) **Drove PR #46 to green:** the ENH-#41 B+C PR's "Lint and
  format checks" CI job was failing on a `ruff format` diff in `service.py`'s
  `CONFIGURATOR_MANAGED_KEYS` tuple (the PR's local gate had run `ruff check`
  but not `ruff format --check`); committed `52f1cd7` to fix it — all 7 PR
  checks now green and mergeable. (2) **Implemented ENH-#43** on draft
  [PR #47](https://github.com/skull-01/script.oppo203.iso.external/pull/47)
  (`claude/enh43-lib-subpackages-r9k2m4x7`, tip `69e32b3`): moved all 46
  `resources/lib` modules into `tv/`/`oppo/`/`avr/`/`kodi/` (incl. `version.py`
  → `kodi/`); added a lazy `sys.meta_path` alias finder in
  `resources/lib/__init__.py` so legacy flat names (`resources.lib.X` + bare
  `X`) resolve to the same canonical objects; made module-top cross-family
  imports explicit while keeping lazy in-function imports bare; updated the
  `version.py` importers in `sync_version.py` (project-root sentinel),
  `package.yml`, `package_release.sh`, `verify.sh`, `audit_release.py`; updated
  ~70 flat-path test literals + the kodi-stub contexts (new
  `tests/_support/lib_buckets.py`) + new `tests/__init__.py` for the
  unittest-discover path; pragma'd 12 now-dead bare-name fallback branches;
  added a per-test isolation fixture (`69e32b3`) to remove `-n auto` flakiness
  the move exposed. Gates: `pytest -n auto` 865/3 (green across repeats),
  serial coverage **99.07%**, ruff check+format clean, `unittest discover`
  484 OK, `audit_release` 580/580, runtime ZIP 70 files (50 bucketed). SHA
  `18a97a6` commented on issue #43. **§3a rewritten** to record both in-flight
  PRs (#46 + #47); **§3b untouched** (no configurator work). **§15** gained an
  ENH-#43 journey bullet; **§17a** #43 row + #41 tip + "Last refreshed"
  updated. **Header unchanged** — `main` had no operational changes this
  session (ENH-#43 lives on the branch / PR #47, not merged). Software-verified
  only; Phase A + Phase C steps for #47 queued in the manual checklist.
- **2026-05-29 (EOD — PR #47 + #46 merge session)** — Addon session that drove
  the two in-flight draft PRs to merge. Reviewed both; found the prior §3a
  "disjoint files" claim was wrong (they overlap on `service.py` /
  `tests/test_all.py` / `docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md`). Merged **PR #47**
  (ENH-#43 lib split) at `3ba5009`; then integrated the new `main` into **PR #46**'s
  branch locally (clean auto-merge), ran the **full gate on the combined tree**
  (commit `126bac9`: `pytest -n auto` 886/3, serial coverage 99.07%, ruff clean,
  `unittest discover` 505 OK, `audit_release` 580/580, doc/version/i18n/layout
  `--check` OK), pushed (pre-push hook re-ran the coverage gate), waited for CI
  green, then merged **PR #46** (ENH-#41 Parts B+C) at `f21033b`. Both
  `claude/enh4*` branches deleted. Merge SHAs commented on issues #43 and #41
  (left open for operator). **§3a rewritten** to the merged state + a "verify the
  combination, not two green CIs" lesson; **§3b untouched** (no configurator
  work). **§15** gained a merge bullet; **§17a** rows #41/#43 + "Last refreshed"
  updated. **Header** "Last sync" `bc79649` → `f21033b`, tests `865` → **886
  passed, 3 skipped**, coverage `99.05%` → **99.07%**. No new issues/branches;
  ENH-#42 now unblocked by #43's bucket layout. Phase A/C on-device verification
  of #40/#46/#47 still deferred.

# §21 Questions log

_Q&A pairs from substantive conversations (clarifying scope, picking between approaches,
defining terminology). Append after each substantive turn. Newest-last._

### 2026-05-28 — Aesthetic + stack + repo layout for the configurator

- **Q:** Which tech stack should we build the configurator in?
  **A:** Tauri 2 (Rust + web UI) — natural port from the React/CSS prototype.
- **Q:** Where should the configurator code live?
  **A:** Subdirectory in this repo (`configurator/`).
- **Q:** Which aesthetic direction?
  **A:** Direction A — Warm Paper (default per design handoff).

### 2026-05-28 — Naming

- **Q:** Is "installer" the right word?
  **A:** No — the Kodi add-on is installed by Kodi; this Windows app *configures* the
  already-installed add-on. Renamed everything to "OppoKodiAddon Configurator" / verb
  "configure" / "set up". Directory `installer/` → `configurator/`.

### 2026-05-28 — Issue model under the new handoff

- **Q:** GitHub Issues, PR-only, or hybrid?
  **A:** Hybrid — Issues for bug/enhancement tracking, PRs for delivery.

### 2026-05-29 — Sequencing ENH-#41 against PR #40; in-add-on guidance hint mechanism

- **Q:** Should ENH-#41 (configurator-owns-config) ship as one PR or be split
  against PR #40 (strip-wizard, still draft)?
  **A:** Split into three parts. **Part A** (policy doc to
  [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) + [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)) ships now
  from `main` — no overlap with #40's diff. **Parts B** (in-add-on guidance
  hint on settings open) and **C** (settings.xml ownership marker) wait until
  #40 merges; both modify `resources/settings.xml`, which #40 renames
  (`<category id="wizard">` → `<category id="playback">`) and trims
  (`wizard_mode` removed). Doing B + C now would create avoidable merge
  friction.
- **Q:** For Part B's in-add-on guidance hint, which mechanism — a static
  label at the top of `settings.xml`, a `service.py` first-open-per-session
  `xbmcgui.Dialog().notification`, or both?
  **A:** Both. Static label is permanent visible guidance; the notification
  draws attention exactly once per Kodi session (tracked via
  `xbmcgui.Window(10000).setProperty(...)`, which clears on Kodi restart).
  Most code, strongest UX guarantee.
